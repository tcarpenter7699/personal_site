                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>Music has always been a big part of my life. I am almost always listening to music. I grew up with classic rock and metal so most of my taste has been formed around that but I'll listen to pretty much anything.</p>

                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>Video games are a big pastime for me. Similar to music, I'll play pretty much anything or whatever my friends are playing. Racing games, sports games, and RPGs are some of my favorites.</p>

                <h2>Cars</h2>
                <p>I've always loved cars. The mechanical aspects and stats catch my attention just as much as a nice body line. My dream car changes constantly but I love everything from classic muscle to modern exotic supercars.</p>
